For Drupal 7 this module creates a new ImageToolkit which uses other toolkits in the background. The secondary toolkit could be the core GD or the ImageMagick toolkit provided by ImageMagick module. TinyPNG module just calls the functions of the secondary toolkit in the background but in the last step it sends the image to the TinyPNG API to compress it.
